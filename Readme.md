# Campy.NET
Campy.NET ("CLI AMP-like API" is a library for 
enabling general purpose GPU computing within 
the Microsoft Common Language Infrastructure, such as C#.
The Campy.NET API is similar to Microsoft's C++ AMP,
implemented as a layer interfacing C++ AMP and
generated libraries of your lambda function kernels
to CLI languages. The source is free and open source.
